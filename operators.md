# JavaScript Assignment Operators

In JavaScript, assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They combine an assignment operation with another operation like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. Here are the main assignment operators along with examples:

## 1. `=`

The `=` operator is the simplest assignment operator. It assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.

```javascript
let x = 5; // Assigns the value 5 to variable x
```

## 2. +=

The `+=` operator adds the value on the right to the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.

```javascript
let y = 10;
y += 3; // Equivalent to y = y + 3; => y is now 13
```

## 3. -=

The `-=` operator subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.

```javascript
let z = 7;
z -= 2; // Equivalent to z = z - 2; => z is now 5
```

## 4. *=

The `*=` operator multiplies the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.

```javascript
let a = 4;
a *= 3; // Equivalent to a = a * 3; => a is now 12
```

## 5. /=

The `/=` operator divides the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.

```javascript
let b = 20;
b /= 5; // Equivalent to b = b / 5; => b is now 4
```

## 6. %=

The `%=` operator assigns the remainder of dividing the variable on the left by the value on the right to the variable.

```javascript
let c = 17;
c %= 5; // Equivalent to c = c % 5; => c is now 2
```

## 7. **=

The `**=` operator raises the variable on the left to the power of the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.

```javascript
let d = 2;
d **= 3; // Equivalent to d = d ** 3; => d is now 8
```

These assignment operators are commonly used in JavaScript to perform operations on variables and update their values in a concise manner.
